    <p><h5>Sink your teeth into a delicious restaurant-style,
         hamburger recipe made from lean beef. 
         Skip the prepackaged patties and take the extra time to craft up
          your own, and that little extra effort will be worth it.
          <br> To make cheeseburgers, about 1 minute before burgers are done, top with sliced cheese; 
        <br>continue cooking until cheese begins to melt. </h5></p>

                <li>lettuce</li>
                <li>tomatoes</li>
                <li>bread buns</li>

            <h3>steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>In a bowl, mix ground beef, egg, onion, bread crumbs, Worcestershire, garlic, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper until well blended. Divide mixture into four equal portions and shape each into a patty about 4 inches wide.</li>
               <br> <li>Lay burgers on an oiled barbecue grill over a solid bed of hot coals or high heat on a gas grill (you can hold your hand at grill level only 2 to 3 seconds); close lid on gas grill. Cook burgers, turning once, until browned on both sides and no longer pink inside (cut to test), 7 to 8 minutes total. Remove from grill.</li>
              <br>  <li>Lay buns, cut side down, on grill and cook until lightly toasted, 30 seconds to 1 minute.</li>
               <br> <li>Spread mayonnaise and ketchup on bun bottoms. Add lettuce, tomato, burger, onion, and salt and pepper to taste. Set bun tops in place.</li>
